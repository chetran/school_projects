***  Assignment 3, Caesar cipher ***

Your task is to make a small program that breaks the code behind an encrypted
text message. To find the "key". Here is one example:

Zr Fqdfnq Rzlrz zvnjd nmd lnqmhmf eqnl tmdzrx cqdzlr gd entmc ghlrdke
sqzmrenqldc hm ghr adc hmsn z fhfzmshb hmrdbs ...

We know that the sender has used the Caesar cipher. You find a description of
this old encryption method here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

The encrypted message is found in a file. You shall break the code, to find the
key. And write the decoded text to another filer. Big and small letters, spaces
and characters shall be kept as in the input file. You can assume that the text
is English. Accordingly, the only letters you have to care about a to z, not å,
ä and ö.

The code breaking should be done by brute force, i.e. to test all possible
shifts and check which one that gives the best result. As help, you get a word
list with one thousand common English words. The word list is also provided as
a file. You shall loop all shifts and count the number of hits against the word
list. The text can include words not found in the list, but the shift giving
the highest number of hits should still be the correct one.

As usual you get a number of tests that help you to implement the functions you
need. The tests assume that you only use positive shifts, even for the
decryption. This works as a text that is encrypted with a shift of 2 (a is
encoded as c, z as b, ...) is decoded with a shift of 24. Note that there are
26 letters in the English alphabet and a shift of 26 gives no encryption.

If the input file holds the text above, then the text in the output file shall
look like this:

As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself
transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect ...

Can you see with what shift the text is encoded? And what key that was needed to
decode?
